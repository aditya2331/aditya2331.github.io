I am an incoming MS student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSD, with a specialization in Communication Theory and Systems. My research interests revolve around applying ideas and architectures from Machine Learning to design the next generation of Wireless Systems. Prior to joining UCSD, I was an EE undergrad at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

During my time at IITM, I worked on various topics, including satellite and vehicular communications, medical signal reconstruction and deep learning. I was a part of our international competition team, [Avishkar Hyperloop](https://avishkarhyperloop.com/), where I built embedded systems for hyperloop technologies. I also worked on efficiently scaling LLM pre-training during my summer internship at [Adobe's MDSR Lab](https://adobe.mdsr.live/) and subsequently received a return offer.
