Hi! I'm a recent EE graduate passionate about finding innovative solutions to complex problems. My research interests revolve around applying ideas and architectures from ML to design the next generation of wireless systems.

During my time at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), I worked on various topics, including satellite and vehicular communications, medical signal reconstruction and deep learning. I was a part of our international competition team, [Avishkar Hyperloop](https://avishkarhyperloop.com/), where I built embedded systems for hyperloop technologies. I also worked on the efficient scaling of network training during my summer internship at [Adobe's MDSR Lab](https://adobe.mdsr.live/) and subsequently received a return offer.
